    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The real secret here is making sure you sear the meat before the long,
      slow braising. Serve with mashed potatoes.</p>
    <p>My mother used to make savory, slow cooker pot-roast all the time
      growing up, and it always brought a smile to my face whenever we had
      that for dinner. This recipe attempts to replicate that same feeling
      while also providing a challenge for those looking for it. Though the
      recipe is more involved than the other recipes, the rewards are worth
      it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (5 pound) bone-in beef pot roast</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>8 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>3 medium carrots</li>
      <li>2 stalks celery, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Step One: Generously season both sides of roast with salt and pepper.
	Sprinkle flour over the top until well coated, and pat it into the meat.
	Shake off any excess.</li>
      <li>Step Two: Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat
	until hot. Sear the roast on both sides for 5-6 minutes each, until
	well browned. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
      <li>Step Three: Reduce the heat to medium and stir in mushrooms and
	butter; cook for 3-4 minutes.</li>
      <li>Step Four: Stir in onion; cook for 5 minutes, until onions are
	translucent and begin to brown. Add garlic, stir for about a minute.
      </li>
      <li>Step Five: Stir in 1 1/2 tablespoons flour; cook and stir for about
	1 minute. Add tomato paste, and cook for another minute.</li>
      <li>Step Six: Slowly add chicken stock, stir to combine, and return to
	simmer. Remove skillet from the heat.</li>
      <li>Step Seven: Place carrots and celery in the slow cooker. Place roast
	over the vegetables and pour in any accumulated juices. Add rosemary
	and thyme.</li>
      <li>Step Eight: Pour onion and mushroom mixture over the top of the roast.
	Cover slow cooker, turn to High and cook the roast for 5-6 hours, until
	the meat is fork tender.</li>
      <li>Step Nine: Skim off any fat from the surface and remove the bones.
	Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
