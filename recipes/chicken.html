    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Seasoned, browned chicken breasts slow cooked with lemon juice, garlic,
      and chicken bouilon. A wonderful 'fix and forget' recipe that is easy and
      pleases just about everyone. Great served with rice or pasta, or even
      alone.</p>
    <p>This recipe is a favorite of mine, as it requires very simple ingredients
      and very little prep before you throw it in the slow cooker. It's also
      tasty! With a decent proportion of spices combined with the lemon juice,
      the chicken has a little extra "kick" to it that I enjoy. I like to make
      it for my significant other and I when we want a decent meal without
      having to fuss about the kitchen for half an hour before eating. You can
      just throw it in the Crock-Pot a few hours ahead of dinnertime, and voila!
