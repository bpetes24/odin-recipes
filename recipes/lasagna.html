    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="text">This Crock-Pot lasagna recipe is so easy, you might think that you
      missed something. It is a delicious slow cooker meal!</p>
    <p class="text">Personally, I <em>love</em> lasagna, but I also love slow cooking. So,
      this recipe marries my two passions into one convenient recipe suitable
      for any family gathering or large dinner plans you may have (or maybe
      you can just have the leftovers all to yourself). Either way, lasagna
      <strong>cannot</strong> be beat and neither can this recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li class="list">1 medium onion, chopped</li>

      <li class="list">1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li class="list">1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li class="list">Step One: Cook ground beef, onion, and garlic in a large skillet over
